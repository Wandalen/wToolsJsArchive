The question he was most interested in was “How long after one becomes interested in music is it that one becomes world class?

== is it for me?

He analyzed thousands of musical pieces produced between the years of 1685 to 1900, which covered the majority of classical compositions.

Next, Hayes mapped out the timeline of each composer’s career and calculated how long they had been working before they created their popular works.

What he discovered was that nearly every single “masterwork” was written after year ten of the composer’s career.

== During the Project

~ image:/file/p/working-late.jpg

== Communication : questioning

- free client from questions he doesn't care
- don't forget to ask client about outstanding / anomaly / strange aspects
- try to simplify questions for yes / no answers
- convert complex question into series of simple questions

== Communication

- try to understand when and what communication is comfortable for client
-- find compromise with your preferences
-- try to make communication comfortable for both sides
-- optimal time of a day
-- optimal duration
-- optimal channel - video, voice, text, letters
-- optimal mean - use messengers and tools of collaboration client comfortable to work with
- report to your client at least weakly
- getting feedback and letting client know you are willing to redo will save your reputation

= Good Will

- be proactive in making work and leave decisions making for client
-- expect no / yes equally
-- don't overflow client with suggestions
- make client know you are willing to do for him anything within you competence
- if request beyond your competence
-- let client know it
-- let him make decision regarding should or not you learn a new skill
-- if yes, your learning is payed
-- if you are sure that skill will not help you in your career, you may inform client about this

== Logging time

- if hourly, log each minute of work
-- communication
-- letters
-- special research
-- remaking
- not logging time is bad for both sides
- don't log
-- lunch time
-- you are away
-- learning what you intended to know
-- more then 10% on learning
- delete low activity

== Remaking

- if hourly, freelancer should help client redo / improve his work
-- remember, to get perfection many iterations needed
-- remember, client is paying for all your attempts, don't be annoyed with this
-- some client not willing to ask redo work if he see freelancer feels uncomfortable with it
-- in that case you will loose a client without knowing a reason
