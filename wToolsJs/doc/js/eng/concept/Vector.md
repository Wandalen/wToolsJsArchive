# Vector

This is a container for passing data to a routine, contains an ordered finite set of elements (data).

Usually, in programming, a vector is a dynamic one-dimensional array.

```js
var vector1 = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ];
var vector2 = new F32x([ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]);
```

Above are two vectors `vector1` and` vector2` in the form of an array and a typed buffer.

The concept of vectorization is described [here](./Vectorization.md#vectorization).
Read the tutorial on vectorization of routine [here](../tutorial/Vectorize.md).
