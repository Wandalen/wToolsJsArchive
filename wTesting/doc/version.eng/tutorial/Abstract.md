# Abstract

General information about utility Testing.

Framework for convenient unit testing. Utility Testing provides the intuitive interface, simple tests structure, asynchronous code handling mechanism, colorful report, verbosity control and more. Use the utility to get free of routines which can be automated.

Unit tests are written in order to test whether this unit (module) is working. The unit test itself is a code that tests units (parts) of code: functions, modules, or classes.

Unit tests are the easiest to write and are the easiest to understand. The essence of the test unit is to input something to the unit input and check the result on the output. For example, function parameters are provided at the input, and a value is taken at the output. Unit tests provide confidence that the program works as intended. Such tests can be run many times. Successfully passed tests indicates that the changes did not break anything in the code. A failed tests allow you to find out that the changes made to the code have broken its behavior. Investigation of the failed test and a comparison of the expected value with the result of the test gives an opportunity to understand where the error occurred. It makes sense to structure the code so that it is easy to test.
