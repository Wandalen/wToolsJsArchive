## Performance
Spectron is good for integration tests because the integration tests do not have to be fast while Puppeteer is better for unit tests, as unit tests should be fast enough.

Test reports of running similar test cases using Spectron and Puppeteer.

Spectron:

```
  Passed test checks 6 / 6
  Passed test cases 0 / 0
  Passed test routines 2 / 2
  Passed test suites 1 / 1
  Testing ... in 5.422s ... ok
```

Puppeteer:

```
  Passed test checks 6 / 6
  Passed test cases 0 / 0
  Passed test routines 2 / 2
  Passed test suites 1 / 1
  Testing ... in 15.446s ... ok
