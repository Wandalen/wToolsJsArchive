## Subgraph

A subgraph of a graph is another graph formed from a subset of vertices and edges of the original graph.

## Induced subgraph

An induced subgraph of a graph is another graph formed from some subset of vertices of the original graph and those edges of the original graph, which have both endpoints in the induced subgraph.

## Clique

Clique is an induced subgraph which is complete.

## Spanning subgraph

The spanning subgraph of a graph is another graph formed from all vertices of the original graph.

## Walk ~ Chain

The walk is a subgraph sequentially connected vertices of the original graph. It is also called a chain. A walk can have more than one correspondence of a node of the original graph. A walk can have more than one correspondence of an edge of the original graph. In other words, both the vertices and edges of the original graph can be repeated in the walk.

## Open walk

The open walk is a walk that does not have cycle decomposition.

## Closed walk

The closed walk is a walk which has cycle decomposition.

## Trail

The trail is a walk each edge of the original graph of which has one or none corresponding edge in the walk. In other words, vertices of the original graph can be repeated in the trail, but not edges.

## Open trail

The open trail is a trail that does not have cycle decomposition.

## Closed trail ~ Circuit

The closed trail is a trail that has cycle decomposition. The closed trail is also called circuit.

## Euler trail

Euler trail - trail that visits every edge exactly once.

## Path

The path is a walk each edge of the original graph of which has one or none corresponding edge in the walk and each vertex of the original graph of which has one or none corresponding vertex in the walk. In other words, neither vertices nor edges of the original graph can be repeated in the path.

## Open path

The open path is a path that does not have cycle decomposition.

## Closed path ~ Cycle

A closed path is a path which has cycle decomposition. A closed path is also called circuit.

## Diameter

The diameter of a graph is the longest of the shortest path of the graph.

## Neighborhood

The neighborhood is an induced subgraph of the graph formed by all nodes adjacent to v.

## Graph decomposition

Graph decomposition is partitioning of edges of a graph.

## Cycle decomposition

Cycle decomposition - graph decomposition, each element of which is a cycle. Cycle decomposition possible only for even graphs.
