Mixin adds instances accounting functionality to a class. Instancing makes possible to iterate instances of the specific class, optionally create names map or class name map in case of a complicated hierarchical structure. Use Instancing to don't repeat yourself. Refactoring required.

### Try out

```
npm install
node sample/Base.s
```

### To add

npm add 'winstancing@stable'
